# Operationalizing Machine Learning

The Operationlalizing Machine Learning project is part of the Machine Learning Engineer with Microsoft Azure Nanodegree Program on Udacity.

In the project we demonstrate to build a Machine Learning model, deploy the model into production and consume the model via an API. 
This is been achieved in two different ways:
1. Manually within the the Azure Machine Learning Studio
2. In Python by using the SDK

## Architectural Diagram

The main steps in the project are illustrated in the following Diagram:

![diagram](images/01-architecture.png)

* *Authentication*: Prepare infrastructure enabling connection to Azure Machine Learning Studio
* *AutoML Model*: Upload dataset, create compute cluster and configure an experiment with AutoML 
* *Deploy the best model*: Deploy the best model provided by AutoML to allow interaction via API service
* *Enable logging*: Enable Application Insights
* *Consume model endpoints*: Interact with the model via API
* *Create and publish a pipeline*: Automate the workflow (Create Model - Deploy Model - Consume Model) with the SDK
* *Documentation*: Document the model deployed

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
