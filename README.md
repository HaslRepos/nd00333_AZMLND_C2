# Operationalizing Machine Learning

The Operationlalizing Machine Learning project is part of the Machine Learning Engineer with Microsoft Azure Nanodegree Program on Udacity.

In the project we demonstrate to build a Machine Learning model, deploy the model into production and consume the model via an API. 
This is been achieved in two different ways:
1. Manually within the the Azure Machine Learning Studio
2. In Python by using the SDK

## Architectural Diagram

![diagram](images/01-architecture.png)

*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model".

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
